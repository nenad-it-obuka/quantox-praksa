Web development internship at Quantox Technology company, Belgrade RS.   
   
Mentoring by Ivan Radeljic.<br><br>


## Prerequisites   
---      
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:      

* Code editor - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or similar.
* Sass - You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system [from GitHub](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.26.11) and [adding it to your PATH](https://katiek2.github.io/path-doc/).   
That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.   
More info about Sass can be found at [Sass official website](https://sass-lang.com/).
* Git - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.<br><br>


## Using Sass build tool  
---   
Once Sass is installed, you can compile your Sass to CSS using the sass command. You'll need to tell Sass which file to build from, and where to output CSS to.   
For example, running `sass input.scss output.css` from your terminal would take a single Sass file, input.scss, and compile that file to output.css.<br><br>
